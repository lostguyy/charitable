# Charitable
Charitable is a fundraising website codebase, primarily focused on backend development. While some parts of the codebase are currently missing (mostly frontend), you can explore the available backend APIs for the donation and fundraising website. You can also test the APIs using tools like ThunderClient or Postman by connecting them to your database.

## Running the Project
To run the frontend, follow these commands:
**npm install
npm start**


For the backend, use the following commands:
**npm install
nodemon server.js**


## User Roles
Charitable supports three user roles:

**NGO (Non-Governmental Organization)
User/Member
Admin**


## Pages
The website includes the following pages:

**Login**: User authentication and access.
**Sign Up**: User registration.
**Home**: Landing page for users.
**Start a Fundraiser (Create Post)**: Enables users to create fundraising posts.
**View Fundraisers**: Allows users to browse existing fundraising campaigns.
**Fundraiser Detail Page**: Provides detailed information about each fundraising campaign.
**Payment (3rd Party Gateway for Payment)**: Facilitates secure online payments using a third-party gateway.
**Admin Panel**: Features a robust admin panel for managing the platform.


## Functionalities
Key functionalities of the project include:

**Password Hashing**: Secure storage of user passwords.
**Session Maintenance**: Ensuring user sessions remain active during their interactions.
**Different Logins for User/NGO and Admin**: Distinguishing between different user roles for varied access and control.


## Technologies Used
The project utilizes various technologies and frameworks:

**React
Node.js
Express
MongoDB
Material UI
Bootstrap
Stripe Payment Gateway
(For a complete list of dependencies, please refer to the package.json file)**

Feel free to explore the existing codebase, and when time permits, we plan to complete the project by adding the missing frontend components.

Thank you for your interest in our fundraising website project!
